 Command-line calculation of distance between two sets of
 structure factors as .mtz files
 
 The distance is computed from two sets of F's indexed on HKL
 Any pruning on resolution or other criteria should be done
 before processing with SFDist.  The input data consists of
 
 SF1 -- first set of structure factors
 SF2 -- second set of structure factors
